- It uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to a MySQL database to store and retrieve information about the recipes. 

- The user can add new recipes by providing details such as the name, ingredients, instructions, serving size, preparation time, cook time, category, and rating. 

- The program also provides the ability to edit existing recipes and display a list of all the recipes in the database.
